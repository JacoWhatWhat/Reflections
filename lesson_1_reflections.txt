How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helps to save time on troubleshooting.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Returning to an old version gives me access to existing code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It gives you controll over when to commit changes that makes logical sense.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The files are related to one another so it would only make sense to save a repository.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    To check what lines were added and deleted.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It is much easier to go back and find the mistake across multiple commits.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Commit changes to new code that has been written.
