When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you work from multiple workspaces it ensures easy and uniform access to all updated versions on all platforms.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	To be able to choose when to commit so what is committed makes sense to you and can incorporate logical changes.
