When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you work from multiple workspaces it ensures easy and uniform access to all updated versions on all platforms.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	To be able to choose when to commit so what is committed makes sense to you and can incorporate logical changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork is a way to crate a new repository from the owners version without the requirement of permissions when comitting.
	Cloning is to copy an entire repository and all its versions as a complete replica of the original.
	Branch is to create a branch away from the master so as to introduce untested code
